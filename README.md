# 💳 Java Console-Based ATM Machine

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **Java console-based ATM application** designed to simulate basic banking operations. It leverages **core Java concepts** including **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **POJO classes**, and uses **HashMap** and **ArrayList** to handle in-memory data like user accounts, transactions, and ATM operations.

✅ Designed for learning and demonstrating real-world logic in a terminal environment.

## 🔧 Key Features

* 🔐 **User Authentication** (using account number and PIN)
* 💰 **Check Balance**
* 🏧 **Cash Withdrawal**
* 💸 **Cash Deposit**
* 🔄 **Change PIN**
* 🛠️ **Admin Panel**

  * ➕ Add/Delete Users
  * 💼 View All Transactions
  * 💵 Load ATM with Cash

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

* **Java SE (Standard Edition)**
* **HashMap** – For quick access to user data using account numbers
* **ArrayList** – For maintaining transaction logs
* **POJO Classes** – For `Account`, `Transaction`, `Notes`, etc.

## 🚀 Future Scope / Enhancements

* [ ] Switch to file or database storage for persistent user data
* [ ] Add GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX
* [ ] Implement secure hashing for PIN storage (e.g., SHA-256)
* [ ] Add logging and exception handling for robust operations
